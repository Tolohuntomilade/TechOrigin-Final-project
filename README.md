# TechOrigin-Final-project

Funny how I started my whole journey 3months ago at TechOrigin. A complete novice and still one anyways. I didn't know what and how to go about all the 
new terminologies I get to hear everyday. Sometimes totally lost on what and how to go about things.


But I must say, Alhamdulilahi. It hadn't been 100% SMOOTH but all I can say is that the journey was worth 100%. 
First, I want to say a big THANK YOU to all the facilitators most especially; Mr Ifeanyi, Mr Nehemiah, Mr Adam. Thank you so much for always being patient
and every ready to profer suitable solutions to my challenges. Funny though but I an still going to disturb you over and over again because I'm just a baby
that will always need your mentoring and support.

This project covers everything learnt right from the basics of HTML, CSS AND Javascript uptil the use of their specified framework.

Thank you so much for the opportunity!!!
